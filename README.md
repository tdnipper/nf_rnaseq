# Nextflow RNA-seq analysis pipeline
## Overview
[Cappable-seq] (https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2018/01/19/cappable-seq-for-prokaryotic-transcription-start-site-determination) in cells infected with influenza virus returns data regarding how 5' triphosphorylated RNA changes during infection.
This is a pilot experiment attempting to quantify those changes and identify transcripts that change.
